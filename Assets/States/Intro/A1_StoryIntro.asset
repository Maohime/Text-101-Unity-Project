  storyText: "You survey the battlefield that you've created. All sides have been
    at war for a long time, and also evenly matched. Who will win? It will all be
    decided on tonight.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! Its time to go to bed!\" your Mum says coming
    into your room.\r\n\r\nOr at least it would be, if you didn't have to go to bed!\r\n\r\n\"Aw
    Mum! I was just about to do something!\" you protest.\r\n\"Well you can do something
    tomorrow, right now its bedtime, you know the rules. But before you do remember
    to brush your teeth and put these toys away.\"\r\n\"But! but can't I leave them
    out? I got everything set up and like everything! The final battle for the universe
    is going to take place!\"\r\n\r\nYour Mum surveys everything you've set up. You
    have a myriad of unusual toys and figures standing next to each other. You have
    plastic knights standing\r\nnext to space men defending a castle made of blocks
    on one side while across from them has a combination of green army guys in vehicles
    and some metal robots.\r\nAnd yet on the far side of your room is another army
    set up consisting of dinosaurs and some other monsters. She just smiles at your
    creativeness.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, it looks like you went to a lot of trouble,
    so okay. You certainly do have a vivid imagination to come up with some of the
    games you do.\"\r\n\r\nHappily you go brush your teeth, and think about the battle
    that's going to take place tomorrow! General Razor will try to storm the castle
    and Lord Justice\r\nwill defend it! And then the Dino Demons will try to destroy
    everything! It's going to be so cool!\r\n\r\nAfter brushing your teeth, you head
    back to your room where you carefully step around the figures you've set up with
    care and get into bed. \r\nOf course as usual, you don't fall asleep right away;
    you read a couple pages of your favorite comic book first. Man you wish real
    life wasn't as boring as it is.\r\nThere's no magic, no super heroes, no giant
    robots, no nothing! You often wished you lived in a world with all of those things.\r\n\r\nYou
    turn off the lights in your room when your Mum checks on you again and demands
    you go to sleep. You're still a little to wound up to fall asleep though, \r\nso
    you just lie in your bed thinking how tomorrows battle is going to play out.\r\n\r\nOf
    course one bad thing about having an overactive imagination is letting it run
    away with you. Your room is dark, with only the dim moonlight shining in\r\nand
    creating creepy shadows on your walls. You begin to think the shadows are moving,
    begin to get a little scared and hide under the covers. \r\nThen you think back
    to something your Mum told you the last time you got scared like this: \"Monsters
    aren't real. Nothing like that exists in this world.\"\r\nOf course she's right,
    after all you just thought the world you lived in was boring by not having those
    types of things in it.\r\n\r\nYou slowly peer out from under your covers, but
    unfortunately this isn't the work of your imagination. \r\nThese shadows ARE
    moving and now they're right by the side of your bed. Red dots form their eyes
    and a bluish light form their grinning maws. \r\nBefore you can cry out, one
    of them puts its hand over your mouth and puts its other hand to its own with
    its index finger to its lips. \r\n(Or rather where its lips would be if it had
    any)\r\n\r\n\"Shhhhhhh, the master wants to see you, there will be plenty of
    time to cry then, little one. Open up the portal.\" The shadow says\r\n\r\nSuddenly
    a purple portal opens up where your wardrobe is, and two of the shadow creatures
    grab and carry you into it. \r\nThe shadows run around you as you're carried
    down the green tunnel which the portal has lead into. \r\nThey excitedly talk
    about how their master will be pleased for getting you. Of course all you're
    doing right now is panicking, \r\nand you start to struggle to get away, surprisingly,
    you manage to break free of their grip and start trying to run back to where
    they entered this thing.\r\n\r\n\"Get him! He's trying to run away!\"\r\n\"Do
    it quickly before the portal starts collapsing!\"\r\n\r\nAs you hear the shadows
    giving orders to each other, the portal tunnel that you're in is indeed starting
    to flash and blink a lot, \r\nwhen you look down at your running feet, the purple
    light \"supporting\" you disappears every now and then revealing only blackness.
    \r\nYou can see your room just up ahead and you ALMOST reach it, before the green
    tunnel disappears completely.\r\n\r\nYou yell and scream about how you wish you
    back home as you fall through the endless void, and while that doesn't happen,
    you do suddenly appear someplace else\r\n\r\nYou land roughly, scraping your
    legs and knees and getting your pajamas all dusty. After brushing yourself off
    and rubbing your hurting legs, \r\nyou get a better look at your surroundings.\r\n\r\nYou're
    in what looks to be the middle of nowhere, though there is a small group of rickety
    looking houses nearby, probably a small village.\r\n\r\nOne thing is for certain,
    you know you aren't on Earth, because, a small multi-colored lizard like creature
    with three eyes scurries by your feet \r\nand into the wilderness beyond. You're
    still scared, but also fascinated by this place; however, \r\nyou realize you
    need to figure out how to get back home and what exactly is going on."
